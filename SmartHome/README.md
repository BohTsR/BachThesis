Here we will take a closer look at the Smart Home project and all the necessary tools for its implementation

## Components and tools
1. Microcontroller ESP32
2. Sensors, such us DTH22
3. Driver for ESP32
4. Tohnny IDE

Basically, these are all the necessary components for a successful implementation

## Installation
1. To begin with, we need to install the development environment for Python, where we can write all the basic functionality that will be in the code. To do this, we install the [*Thonny IDE*](https://thonny.org/).

2. After successful installation, we go to our microcontroller and see which driver it uses. To do this, we find the chip, as shown in the picture, and its name will correspond to the driver we need

3. Next, we connect the ESP32 to the computer, log in to Thonny, and choose a connection port
