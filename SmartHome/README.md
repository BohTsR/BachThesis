Here we will take a closer look at the Smart Home project and all the necessary tools for its implementation

## Components and tools
1. Microcontroller ESP32
2. Sensors, such us DTH22
3. Driver for ESP32
4. Tohnny IDE

Basically, these are all the necessary components for a successful implementation


## Usage and MircoPython
The main point of the Smart Home project is to measure environmental indicators, for example, to adjust the temperature, humidity, or air quality for a comfortable living environment.
This repository contains both the individual parts of the code for the sensors and the master code that is responsible for the complete measurement and sending of data to the Master ESP32.
