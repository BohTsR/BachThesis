## Tools
Only the software part of the bachelor's thesis will be used here. We only need AWS to host the website, transfer data, and stack data in arrays. 

## Usage and Python
The repository contains the code for the lambada function, as well as the code for the Master ESP32, which transmits data using the HTTP protocol, and the website template itself.
