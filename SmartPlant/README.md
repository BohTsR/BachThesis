Here we will take a closer look at the Smart Plant project and all the necessary tools for its implementation.

## Components and tools
1. Microcontroller ESP32
2. Sensors, such us Soil Moisture
3. Driver for ESP32
4. Tohnny IDE

Basically, these are all the necessary components for a successful implementation.

## Usage and MicroPython
In this project, the most difficult part will be setting up the project itself, i.e. configuring the components so that they are fully autonomous
